<h1 align="center">👋 Hello There!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Web Developer</h3>
<p>I'm Samantha Malorni and currently learning full stack web development at Nashville Software School. Prior to my journey in web development, my background was in state law enforcement and disability advocacy. My passion in web development and accessibility derived from my own personal experience and during my time as a disability advocate when I saw how beneficial apps were for my clients. I wanted to learn more about technology and the development process behind the scenes. It led me on a new journey, learning coding, UX/UI and accessibility. My mission is to create user-friendly, accessible and inclusive websites and applications for all users and provide solutions to challenging barriers.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I am a cricut nerd who loves anything art-related, a wine aficionado, and enjoys dog-sitting, solo travel, photography, meditation/float therapy/yoga, and a good suspenseful horror film. </p>
