# 👋 Hello there! 

My name is Samantha Malorni. I'm excited to be on a new journey 🚀, learning full-stack web development at Nashville Software School. With a passion in accessibility that derived from my own personal experiences, my goal is to focus on inclusive user experience in digital space and solve challenging barriers. It is important to me that we create accessible websites and applications for all users, especially for those with disabilities.
