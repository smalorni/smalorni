# 👋 Hello there! 

My name is Samantha Malorni. I'm excited to be on a new journey 🚀, learning full-stack web development at Nashville Software School. With a passion in accessibility, I hope to combine my technical skills, problem-solving and creativity to improve user experience and create accessible websites and applications that supports inclusion for all users, especially for those with disabilities.
